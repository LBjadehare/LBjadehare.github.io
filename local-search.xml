    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Once upon a time, in a kingdom Far Far Away, the king and queen were blessed with a beautiful baby girl. And throughout the land, everyone was happy, until the sun went down. And they saw that their daughter was cursed with a frightful enchantment that took hold each and every night. Desperate, they sought the help of a fairy godmother, who had them lock the young princess away in a tower, there to await the kiss of the handsome Prince Charming.<br>It was he who would chance the perilous journey through blistering cold and scorching desert, traveling for many days and nights, risking life and limb to reach the Dragon’ S keep. For he was the bravest, and most handsome in all the land. And it was destiny that his kiss would break the dreaded curse.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>By Albert Einstein</p><p>The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day.<br>Never lose a holy curiosity.<br>Try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value. He is considered successful in our day who gets more out of life than he puts in. But a man of value will gives more than he receives.</p>]]></content>
